zzd
===

This is my first complex Zig project.  

zzd will loosely copy the functionality of [xxd](https://github.com/ckormanyos/xxd). It will dump the hex of a given file, or from stdin.  
I got the project idea (and name) from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnnx1bkFXng).  
As this is a project intended for learning as much as possible about the language, I may choose to accomplish some effects in a convoluted way.  
This project exists for me to learn about Zig. As such, I may go out of my way to make the program more complicated than necessary to learn about parts of the language.  

## Status

Not functional.  

## Next Steps

- Read text from stdin or a supplied file.  
- Reword error handling properly before moving on.
